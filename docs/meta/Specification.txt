Specification for Dilute Metadata (.meta) files
-------------------------------------------------------

Dilute Metadata files are simple files containing information
related to the download of cached files.

They are simple text files where every line can be either
a comment or an attribute related to the download.

Custom markup for Notepad++ is provided alongside this documentation
(see /docs/meta/Markup for Notepad++.xml).



Attributes

Every attribute begins with the name of the attribute,
followed by a colon.

The supported attributes are:
- type: The type of file that was downloaded. Currently supported:

        => Text file that will be used as a license that the user
           has to accept in order to use the mod / library
